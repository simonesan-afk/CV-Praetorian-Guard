## 📊 HEURISTIC ALIGNMENT SCORE: 78/100
**Trust Level:** High (Detailed input provided)

### 🧱 Scoring Breakdown:
* **Hard Skills (32/40):** Strong semantic match for *Python, AWS, and SQL*. 
    * *Gap identified:* Missing specific experience with *Kubernetes*.
* **Experience & Continuity (25/30):** 8+ years of relevant history.
    * ⚖️ **Anti-Bias Trigger:** A 12-month gap (2021-2022) was detected. Context provided: *"Health/Family recovery"*. Following the internal protocol, **no penalty was applied** to the score.
* **Impact & Metrics (15/20):** Good use of quantified achievements (e.g., *"Optimized database queries reducing latency by 40%"*).
* **ATS & Readability (6/10):** Standard layout, but could benefit from more specific industry-standard action verbs in the latest role.

## 🛠️ Tactical Recommendations (Fixes)
1.  **Bridge the K8s Gap:** If you have any experience with Docker or containerization, highlight it more clearly to compensate for the Kubernetes requirement.
2.  **Modernize Action Verbs:** Replace generic terms like "Responsible for" with "Spearheaded" or "Architected" to improve the ATS impact score.
3.  **Quantify Early Roles:** Your first two years of experience lack metrics. Try to estimate the scale of the projects (e.g., number of users or data volume).
