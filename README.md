## 📖 Overview

**PRAETOR v5.5** is an advanced System Prompt designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.....

Developed by **Friulanika Corp.**, it acts as a heuristic engine to analyze the alignment between a **Curriculum Vitae (CV)** and a **Job Description (JD)**. Unlike standard AI summaries, PRAETOR uses a strict scoring logic, enforces privacy protocols, and applies anti-bias context to career gaps.
 (Keyword Visibility)
* **🧠 Educational Feedback:** Instead of just saying "bad resume," it explains *why* and provides tactical fixes.

## 🚀 HOW TO USE

1.  **Copy the Prompt:** Copy the entire content of the file `v5.5 STABLE.txt`.
2.  **Initialize the AI:** Paste the text into a new chat session with your preferred LLM (ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, etc.).
3.  **Wait for the Handshake:** The system will reply: `👋 PRAETOR v5.5 Ready.`
4.  **Input Data:** Paste your **REDACTED CV** and the target **Job Description**.
5.  **Review Report:** The system will generate a markdown report with a score, trust level, and tactical fixes.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🛡️ Privacy-First Logic:** Automatically detects and flags Personal Identifiable Information (PII) if accidentally included, advising the user to redact it.
* **⚖️ Anti-Bias Experience Scoring:** Recognizes human context. Career gaps (>6 months) labeled as caregiving, health, or education are **not penalized**.
* **📊 Heuristic Scoring Model:** Provides an indicative score out of 100 based on four pillars:
    * **Hard Skills** (Semantic Coverage)
    * **Experience** (Context-Aware)
    * **Quantified Impact** (Metrics & Data)
    * **ATS Optimization**
## 🧮 Scoring Logic

The total score (100 points) is calculated as follows:

| Component | Points | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hard Skills** | **40** | Semantic matching of critical skills found in the JD. |
| **Experience** | **30** | Relevance of history + Continuity (incorporating anti-bias logic for gaps). |
| **Impact** | **20** | Presence of quantified metrics (%, $, user growth). |
| **ATS Check** | **10** | Keyword presence check for automated screening systems. |
