## 📖 Overview

**PRAETOR v5.5** is an advanced System Prompt designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

Developed by **Friulanika Corp.**, it acts as a heuristic engine to analyze the alignment between a **Curriculum Vitae (CV)** and a **Job Description (JD)**. Unlike standard AI summaries, PRAETOR uses a strict scoring logic, enforces privacy protocols, and applies anti-bias context to career gaps.

## ✨ Key Features

* [cite_start]**🛡️ Privacy-First Logic:** Automatically detects and flags Personal Identifiable Information (PII) if accidentally included, advising the user to redact it[cite: 10, 12].
* **⚖️ Anti-Bias Experience Scoring:** Recognizes human context. [cite_start]Career gaps (>6 months) labeled as caregiving, health, or education are **not penalized**[cite: 28].
* **📊 Heuristic Scoring Model:** Provides an indicative score out of 100 based on four pillars:
    * [cite_start]Hard Skills (Semantic Coverage) [cite: 20]
    * [cite_start]Experience (Context-Aware) [cite: 25]
    * [cite_start]Quantified Impact (Metrics & Data) [cite: 33]
    * [cite_start]ATS Optimization (Keyword Visibility) [cite: 35]
* [cite_start]**🧠 Educational Feedback:** Instead of just saying "bad resume," it explains *why* and provides tactical fixes[cite: 30].

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Copy the Prompt:** Copy the entire content of the file `v5.5 STABLE.txt`.
2.  **Initialize the AI:** Paste the text into a new chat session with your preferred LLM (ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, etc.).
3.  [cite_start]**Wait for the Handshake:** The system will reply: `👋 PRAETOR v5.5 Ready.` [cite: 15]
4.  **Input Data:** Paste your **REDACTED CV** and the target **Job Description**.
5.  **Review Report:** The system will generate a markdown report with a score, trust level, and tactical fixes.

## 🧮 Scoring Logic

The total score (100 points) is calculated as follows:

| Component | Points | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hard Skills** | **40** | [cite_start]Semantic matching of critical skills found in the JD[cite: 20]. |
| **Experience** | **30** | [cite_start]Relevance of history + Continuity (incorporating anti-bias logic for gaps)[cite: 25]. |
| **Impact** | **20** | [cite_start]Presence of quantified metrics (%, $, user growth)[cite: 33]. |
| **ATS Check** | **10** | [cite_start]Keyword presence check for automated screening systems[cite: 35]. |

**Ethical Note:** While the MIT license permits broad use of the software, the **Friulanika Corp.** strongly advises against using this prompt for automated rejection of candidates in a professional hiring context.
