# Contributing to CV-Praetorian-Guard

Thank you for your interest in **PRAETOR (CV-Praetorian-Guard)**.

## ⛔ No Contributions Accepted
At this stage, this repository is **closed to external contributions**. 

[cite_start]This project is released as a specific, stable version (`v5.5 STABLE`) intended for **personal educational reflection only**. The logic contains carefully tuned heuristic parameters and ethical safety guardrails (Privacy & Anti-Bias) that must remain strictly consistent.

### Why?
* [cite_start]**Safety Integrity:** The prompt includes strict protocols for PII detection and ethical boundaries [cite: 8, 10] that we do not want accidentally weakened by third-party edits.
* **Stability:** This is a "Stable" release. We are not looking to change the scoring logic or the heuristic model at this time.

## 🐛 Found a Bug?
If you discover a critical failure (e.g., the prompt hallucinates or fails to protect privacy), please simply **open an Issue** to report it. Do not submit a Pull Request.

## 📄 License & Use
[cite_start]You are free to use this prompt for your own personal self-assessment as described in the disclaimer[cite: 5].
